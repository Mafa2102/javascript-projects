      <li>Ability to create.</li>
      <li>It's about building, learning, growing, and finding satisfaction in every line of code.</li>
      <li>The pay is high.</li>

    <!-- a goes here --> <a href="https://www.webelements.com/" target="_blank">WebElements</a>
    <!-- p goes here --> <p>I will be building my personal website. I have never had a personal website before as I never needed to present myself to the outside world. But nowadays I believe it will be nice to have a single place where I could aggregate all my blogs (or links) and other information. It will also make it easy for everyone to get in touch with me. So you can see what my goals are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Nicely looking website to represent myself</li>
      <li>List all my blogs and other information</li>
      <li>Enable easy contact</li>
    </ol>
